## Hey there 👨‍💻 ##

- 👋 Hi, I’m Phelipe Garcia from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Backup Analyst and SysAdmin since 2017 and currently I'm Backup Analyst at  @StefaniniGlobal . I'm passionate about open source projects, so I've created some projects on Github using Linux and Bacula backup.

- 📚 Learning IaC (Terraform, Ansible, Chef), K8s, CI/CD(Jenkins and GitLab).
- ☁️️ AWS and Azure practices
- 🚀 #sre #cloud #linux #devops #aws #zabbix #docker #newrelic
